# LocalSourceNL

Shared twitter account with a new author each week for NL based developers and local IT community activists.

The idea of shared microblog accounts originally came from the Russian-speaking [community](http://jsunderhood.ru), which currently have multiple projects about JS, CSS, Web Design, Backend and etc.

The main target of this format is to enable community members discussing more interesting topics in approachable, open format. We're currently gathering the authors to fill in the agenda for a few months, the first author will start mid-August.

## Our goals
* Help local developers community get to know each other better. Netherlands is the home for thousands of great developers and interesting people who can share lots of great insights and raise interesting discussions.
* Enable more open communication format, comparing to personal twitter account authorship. Share your thoughts on any topic you like to rise a discussion, tweet multiple tweets at a time, expressing your ideas without a limit. 
Usually, authors define big topics per each weekday, eg: Mon - introduction (bio, current company/projects), Tue - frameworks, Wed - community (open source, meetups) and etc.
* Allow local developers to express themselves, show their projects, share their ideas/insights and find more friends in the community.
